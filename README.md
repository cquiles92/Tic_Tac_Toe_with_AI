In this project I learned about recursive functions and how to implement the mini max algorithm into a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
By creating gamestates on the board and assigning a score to a gamestate, it is able to select an optimal move based off the move score.
The move score is calculated by the game state (which awards winning a value of 100, -100 for losing, and a 0 for a draw game) subtracted from the current depth or # of moves.
